The goal is to take what has been discussed in class and what you have already worked on in the earlier practicals, and apply them on a RL problem in a novel environment. This  project will constitute 25% of your final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project grade will be based on the following components:\n",
    "- Online demonstration\n",
    "- Source code\n",
    "- Written report (a 4-page report in NeurIPS workshop paper format: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2020/mnshsmqkjsqz)\n",

    "\n",
    "Briefly, there are two agents: Red and Blue. Red is controlled by you. Blue is controlled by the environment \"AI\".* Both agents always run forward with a speed of 3.5 m/s*. If one of them gets within the reach of the other (a frontal sphere with 0.5 m radius), it gets pushed away automatically with a speed of 3.5 m/s. The only thing that the agents can do is to turn left or right with an angular speed of 180 degrees/s. This means that there are three possible discrete actions that your agent can take every step: Turn nowhere, turn left and turn right. For convenience, there is also a fourth built-in action which turns left or right with uniform probability. An episode begins when you reset the environment and ends when one of the agents fall off the platform. At the end of the episode, the winning agent gets a reward of 10 while the other gets nothing. Therefore, your goal is to train an agent who can maximize its reward by pushing the other agent off the platform or making it fall off the platform by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note that all times are simulation time. That is, 0.02 s per step when timescale is set to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basically, Blue is artificial but not really intelligent. What it does is that every 0.5 s, it updates its destination to the current position of Red plus some random variation (a surrounding circle with a radius of 1.75 m) and smoothly turns to that position.\n",
